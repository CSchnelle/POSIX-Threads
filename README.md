# POSIX-Threads
A program that uses "enzymes" to sort strings.

An enzyme is a function that sorts two consecutive characters. pthreads are used to instantialize and parallelize the enzymes. One enzyme is defined per pair of consecutive characters. This project requires answering questions to demonstrate understanding, creating a function to run enzyme, fixing a memory bug in the enzyme threads function and completing the join enzymes function, and using a test runner to ensure the program passes. 

Included in these files are:

Proj02-Handout Folder:
-orignal files with the bugged, unfinished enzyme program
-instructions 
-test runner program & makefile
(both PC and MAC versions)

Proj02-Complete Folder:
-Document completing all questions assigned
-Completed and working Enzyme.c file
